✨ Just launched an AI-powered Task Manager inside WhatsApp!

🔹 Built using n8n | OpenAI | Google Sheets | WhatsApp API
🔹 Converts natural language messages into tasks (e.g. “Add task to help dad today”)
🔹 Retrieves pending tasks instantly with simple queries (e.g. “What are my tasks due today?”)

💡 The idea was simple: make productivity frictionless. Instead of juggling apps, I can manage all my tasks from the app I already use the most — WhatsApp.

This project reflects my passion for AI automation, workflow design, and real-world problem solving. I’m excited to keep exploring how AI agents can transform everyday workflows into smarter, more efficient systems. 🚀
