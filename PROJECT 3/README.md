Rathinam Blog Generator

This project is built using Google Opal, an experimental AI workflow builder available only in the U.S., which I accessed through a VPN.

The workflow demonstrates how AI can automate the process of blog creation in Rathinam Technical Campus style.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

User enters a blog topic.

The system performs research on both the topic and Rathinamâ€™s writing style.

Generates a complete blog draft.

Creates a matching header image.

Combines everything into a single HTML page, resulting in a ready-to-publish blog post with just one click.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights

Experimented with Google Opal (US-only) by leveraging VPN access.

Automated research, content writing, image generation, and HTML formatting.

Showcases practical application of AI for real-world content automation.
