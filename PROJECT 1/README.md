# 🚀 AI-Powered Document Chat Workflow (n8n + Pinecone + OpenAI)

This project is an **AI workflow** that transforms uploaded documents into a **smart, searchable knowledge base**.  
Built with **n8n, Pinecone, OpenAI, and Google Drive**, it enables **chatting with your documents** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## 🔹 Features
📂 **Google Drive Trigger** → Detects when a new file is uploaded  
✂️ **Text Splitter** → Breaks document into smaller chunks  
🧠 **Embeddings (OpenAI)** → Converts text into vector representations  
📚 **Pinecone (Vector DB)** → Stores embeddings for semantic search  
🤖 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** → Query documents with an AI agent  
💬 **Chat with Documents** → Ask questions and get context-aware answers instantly  

---

## 🔹 Workflow Overview
1. **Upload File (Google Drive)** – Trigger workflow  
2. **Split Text** – Break document into manageable chunks  
3. **Generate Embeddings (OpenAI)** – Create semantic vectors  
4. **Store in Pinecone** – Build a searchable knowledge base  
5. **RAG + AI Agent** – Retrieve context and generate intelligent answers  

---

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- **n8n** – Workflow automation  
- **OpenAI** – Embeddings + AI agent  
- **Pinecone** – Vector database for semantic search  
- **Google Drive API** – File storage & trigger  

---

## 🔹 Use Cases
- Create a **searchable knowledge base** from PDFs & docs  
- Build **AI-powered Q&A bots** for company data  
- Personal research assistant for students, writers, or researchers  
- Automate **document-heavy workflows** with AI  

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Support for multiple file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)  
- Add a web-based chat UI for querying documents  
- Multi-user support with authentication  
- Real-time sync with cloud drives
