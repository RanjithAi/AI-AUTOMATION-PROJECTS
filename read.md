I built my very first workflow using n8n + OpenAI.
This simple flow listens for a chat message, sends it to a Message Model, and allows me to edit the fields before sending a response.

It may look simple, but for me itâ€™s the beginning of exploring:
ðŸ”¹ Workflow Automation
ðŸ”¹ AI Integration
ðŸ”¹ Intelligent Agents

Excited to keep learning, experimenting, and sharing my journey into AI automation.

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™re also working with n8n or exploring AI workflows, Iâ€™d love to connect and exchange ideas!
